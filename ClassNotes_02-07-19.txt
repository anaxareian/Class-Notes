Software Development Life Cycle

In professional environments the structrured framework for building
software is called an SDLC, Software Development Life Cycle. 

It's a lot of work, even for small projects.  

SDLC: Reuirements, Design, Development, Testing & Maintenance. 

Every stage of the SDLC has roles specific to each stage for some 
businesses.  

Which SDLC to use is important.  The two primary methodologies are 
Agile and Waterfall.  There are more than these two, but these two
are the most widely used.  

SDLC are not fluff, they are the meat and potatoes of any software

It provides the basis of project planning
It includes a set of activities, techologies, and deliverables for 
each different kind of SDLC model. 

With a well executed SDLC you decreas risk, and improve client 
relations. 

In the Waterfall Model, there is a linear progression from 
Analysis, Design, Development, Testing, Deployment & Maintenance.

The Waterfall model is more brittle, and changes in scope will tend
to be high risk and cost prohibitive. 

SDLCs started with the Waterfall mdeol. 

Watefall is great when requirements are very well known, the producxt 
definition is stable

The Agile model breaks work down into sprints.  With tight cycles of 
work with breaks.  When working with Agile models, we get enough done
so that we can show the customer soemthintg evryweek.
