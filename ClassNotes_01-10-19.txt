1) Agile vs Waterfall are the only two SDLC types we need to worry about. 
Agile we'll iteratively build your application showing them progress in 
regular, short, intervals.  This allows them to easily identify if 
requiremnts are being met, increasing their chance of retaining you to |
build software projects. 

Allows requirments and associated design changes to added at any time. 

Customer gets to discover what they want, as they basic implementations
of what they asked for produced.

2) Waterfall you are building with the end in mind in a linear fashion, 
with a well defined map of how you intend to get there.  

Assumes all requirements are known up front, with the expectation that
there will be no requirement changes before delivery, because the 
customer knows what they want for real.
