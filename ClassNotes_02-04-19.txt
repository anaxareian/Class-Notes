Welcome to the first class of the February IBG Hiring program.

Welcome to returning and new students.

Those who have got Udemy classes, I hope you've had a chance 
to start viewing and executing on them. 

Finish them and prepare by memorizing the interview questions. 

We're going to plow through a a bunch of content, that will 
teach you what you need to know to become a software engineer.  
All of it is free on the internet. 

You can get there fast, or slow, it's up to you, how you work,
and how much time you have to complete it. 

Just keep going month after month, until you finis the assignments
and  know all the interview questions. 

Do all the things we ask.  

Some can get through the program in 1 month, some will take 12 months. 

We want you to succeed, and move at your own pace.  Just keep 
pushing forward and executing. 

You should be familiar with the Piazza, especially continuing students.

It is an eco system where you contribute, learn, find resources, and
can help others. 

We encourage you to ask questions, respond to questions, and upload 
your homework assignments on the Piazza. 

Statistics of Piazza usage is posted as a part of the Piazza and 
the instructors are looking.  

The Piazza offers experience that is more valuable than what you'll
get in college, because it is not theory, but like the real work
envioronment.  

Email enrollment@ibgsoftware.com if you don't have access to the 
Piazza.  

It has resources, including a list of things you need to execute,
as well as interview questions, and vocabulary.

Our goal is to help all of you get into a great job. 

If you have a question, ask on the Piazza. 

Today's homework is to post your notes in the Piazza right after class. 
And, if you don't have access to the Piazza, send the email to get 
access.
